# Pomodoro timer
---
Hyper Island - The First App module - Brief 9.


### :scroll: Brief:
Create an accessible Pomodoro timer that counts down from 25 minutes and that you can reset after it is done using a framework. Extra challanges are to make a nice design, make it possible to change the time, add break time, add tasks, connect to an API like trello or make it as a PWA.


### :hourglass: Time spent:
1.5 days.


### :checkered_flag: Goals:
Meet the briefs minimal requirements and don't get carried away and ambitious. I wanted to focus on building my portfolio instead since I think I'm gonna need that one more than this timer app.


### :heavy_check_mark: Solution:
I decided to create a very basic pomodoro timer. I wanted it to loop some music while the timer is on since I find it easier to focus with classical or instrumental music, and then stop the music when the timer stops.


### :closed_book: Learnings:

* Working with the Date object in JavaScript which I have never done before
* More practice with React and hooks
* Time is valuable, and I can decide how to use my time more efficiently
